The project currently contains two main files:
1. server/main.cpp
2. main.cpp
These are client and server applications.
There is no implementation using HTTP protocol, for now
the communication is using sockets only.

Messages sent by client is in format:

operation type | number of ints | ints
    32 bits    |    32 bits     | [...]
   1 = sort    |                |
   2 = reverse |                |

In order to provide working solution first I have decided
to not plan application architecture yet and implement
everyting in main.cpp files.

In order to run the app first run the server main then
the client.
